# Control Route Optimizer
A small web application that tries to optimize (to an extent since it's
basically the traveling salesman problem) the addresses being visited
in a day by the civil protection team that are checking whether the shelters
are okay. Simplified constraints:

- The time is pre agreed upon
- Each address at a time can be dispatched to one of the teams available
- Minimize driving time (I intend using some maps API to get that)
